## Hi there, my name's Garrett! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a masterâ€™s student at Georgia Tech studying computer science. I've spent the last four years (my undergraduate career) trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I haven't quite figured it out yet, but after an I&C engineering internship and two major changes, I at least knew I loved writing software. I think the idea of being able to create so much utility out of so little capital really intrigued me. Three MORE internships later and my undergrad complete, I'm still exploring the tech industry. In my senior year, I built a web app for the Georgia Tech chapter of Noblemen, a Christian ministry. After a successful semester, I started collaborating with the founders of Noblemen to bring the app to more campuses! I really enjoy that type of work â€“ helping people build their visions. I think that more engineers should push to interact with clients and understand businesses!

Anywayyyyyy, in case you're interested... In my free time I play pickleball, ultimate frisbee, and I'm starting to get into golf... I love exploring national parks (profile pic at Zion). I hate pineapple on pizza.
